# Goose Desktop App

Native desktop app for Goose built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [ReactJS](https://react.dev/). 

# Prerequisites
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended for managing node versions easier but not required)
- node major version equal to or greater than specified in .nvmrc and package.json
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for building the server)

```
git clone git@github.com:block/goose.git
cd goose/ui/desktop
nvm use
npm install
npm run start
```

# Building notes

This is an electron forge app, using vite and react.js. `gooosed` runs as multi process binaries on each window/tab similar to chrome.

see `package.json`: 

`npm run bundle:default` will give you a Goose.app/zip which is signed/notarized but only if you setup the env vars as per `forge.config.ts` (you can empty out the section on osxSign if you don't want to sign it) - this will have all defaults.

`npm run bundle:preconfigured` will make a Goose.app/zip signed and notarized, but use the following:

```python
            f"        process.env.GOOSE_PROVIDER__TYPE = '{os.getenv("GOOSE_BUNDLE_TYPE")}';",
            f"        process.env.GOOSE_PROVIDER__HOST = '{os.getenv("GOOSE_BUNDLE_HOST")}';",
            f"        process.env.GOOSE_PROVIDER__MODEL = '{os.getenv("GOOSE_BUNDLE_MODEL")}';"
```

This allows you to set for example GOOSE_PROVIDER__TYPE to be "databricks" by default if you want (so when people start Goose.app - they will get that out of the box). There is no way to set an api key in that bundling as that would be a terrible idea, so only use providers that can do oauth (like databricks can), otherwise stick to default goose.

You can also change the branding shown in the desktop UI by setting `GOOSE_DESKTOP_BRAND` when launching the app. For example:

```bash
GOOSE_DESKTOP_BRAND="AirChat Desktop" npm run start
```


# Running with goosed server from source

Set `VITE_START_EMBEDDED_SERVER=yes` to no in `.env`.
Run `cargo run -p goose-server` from parent dir.
`npm run start` will then run against this.
You can try server directly with `./test.sh`
